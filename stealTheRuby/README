Overview:
	This is a game called Steal The Ruby. It is a game
	where the player controls a thief and must maneuver
	through each level. The goal is to acquire the ruby
	and then escape on your bike. There may be guards 
	who will chase the player for a certain amount of 
	time on contact. There may be security cameras that
	will alert all guards to the player's position. If
	the player gets caught by a guard, they will lose
	a life and have to restart the level. Once a player
	loses all 3 lives, its gameover. The game contains
	10 unique levels. After completing all of the levels
	the player will win. If the player collects all 322
	coins during the play through, something may happen
	after completion.
